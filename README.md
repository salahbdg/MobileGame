# MobileGame
Play together, challenge your friends and win or lose

Create a multiplayer game where phones (two or more) discover each other, synchronize, and then randomly select 3 challenges from a pool of at least 6. Each challenge must include a point system based on either time, the quality of responses, or overall performance. At the end, the player with the highest score wins, and a victory sound plays on their device, while a losing sound plays on the other devices.

The challenges must belong to one of the following three categories:

Sensor-Based Challenges – Utilize phone sensors (e.g., accelerometers, sound sensors, etc.).

Touchscreen Motion Challenges – Require specific gestures or interactions on the screen.

Question-Answer Challenges – Can be multiple-choice or open-ended response questions.

The game must include at least one challenge from each category.
